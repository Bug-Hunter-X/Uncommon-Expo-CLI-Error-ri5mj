// Solution might vary depending on the exact error; this is a placeholder.
// Often, it involves resolving dependency conflicts, ensuring correct configurations,
// or refactoring code to be compatible with the Expo framework.
expo.registerRootComponent(App);

//Example of fixing a dependency conflict:
//Check package.json for conflicting dependencies and adjust versions accordingly. 
//Refer to the Expo documentation and package READMEs for compatibility information.

//Example of fixing incorrect configuration:
//Ensure that your `app.json` or `expo.json` is correctly configured and includes
//necessary settings (such as project name, version, and other settings).

//Example of refactoring to be compatible with the Expo framework
//Some packages or APIs that work fine in plain React Native might not work seamlessly with Expo.
//Consider using Expo-specific alternatives or updating your code to support Expo's constraints.
